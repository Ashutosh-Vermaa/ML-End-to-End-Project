 conda create -p venv python==3.7 -y
 to create a virtual environment. -p is used to create virtual env for the present directory, so when we close the Project
 the env also destroys
 venv is the name of the virtual env. -y is for yes in advance if it asks for proceeding

 After creating venv, to activate- conda activate venv/

 then we create a requirement file where we put all the packages required for our Project
 
 To install the requirements from the requirement file- pip install -r requirements.txt

 next, we create a app.py file to write flask code in it. To run a python file: python filename.py

 Now, we send this file to github repository. We add 
 env/
venv/
ENV/

in the .gitignore file so that git doesn;t have to manage the virtual env even when we add the folder to git with virtual environment in it
we can also mention files that we don't want to add to github in .gitignore while doing: 'git add .'git which adds all the files
in the current folder
